Good,better,best. Never let it rest.Till your good is better and your better is best.
Be the one who nurtures and builds.Be the one who has an understanding and a forgiving heart one who looks for the best in people.Leave people better than you found them
Experience is the best teacher.
The best preparation for tomorrow is doing your best today.
